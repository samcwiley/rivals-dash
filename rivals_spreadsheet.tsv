12/3/2024		914	Fleet	W	OO-	928	sm4shbruh	971	Clairen	Godai Delta	2	Fire Capital	1			he was really overusing counter and I got a lot of mileage off of grabbing. Also there was this chain grab thing he kept getting at low percents that I couldn't figure out how to escape. I played very reactively, which was helping.

12/3/2024		942	Fleet	W	OO-	955	Helium	976	Forsburn	Godai Delta	1	Godai Delta	1			I need to figure out what to do against the side b to the stage. Also do not underestimate Forsburn's ability to get the first hit of up smash on platforms. Shield when you land on platform. The cape is far reaching and will hit you from the edge and combo into the strong hit up smash			More ISF Nair

12/3/2024		954	Fleet	W	OO-	964	Atlatl	919	Orcane	Julesvale	1	Rock Wall	1			Almost blew an entire stock lead by looking too aggressively for a final kill. Do not charge fsmash against orcane when he's on the ledge because he can special getup and go right under itg invicibly			More ISF Nair	
12/3/2024		964	Fleet	W	OXO	977	uleksite	992	Kragg	Julesvale	1	Tempest Peak	-1	Aetherean Forest	3	Turns out Kragg is hella slow so I just need to wait out his abilities and be more patient, then he is just combo food.

12/3/2024		977	Fleet	W	XOO	990	FreshWaterFern	1024	Kragg	Julesvale	-1	Godai Delta	2	Tempest Peak	1	This guy was spamming parry like crazy game 1 and I got around it by grabbing more and trying to bait out the parries by mixing up my timings with forward smash. kragg really do get crazy early kills butr I think this is definitely a winning matchup	Kragg	Clairen	More ISF Nair	
12/4/2024		990	Fleet	L	XOX	978	gatordraq	983	Clairen	Julesvale	-1	Godai Delta	1	Aetherean Forest	-1	Not a good idea to play so late. This guy was very aggressive but so much of it was double jump dair over andd over. I need to be more patient and parry the dair, or shield the dair, then parry the up tilt that comes after it if they cross up with the dair or nair.			More ISF Nair	
12/4/2024		978	Fleet	W	XOO	989	[MRY] Sk-iLite	959	Wrastor	Aetherean Forest	-1	Hodojo	1	Fire Capital	2	This guy was really cracked. Fighting wrastor feels like fighting zelda. you can't overextend your combos since he is so floaty. His punish potential is insane. Be careful when recovering high (he will do a spinny thing (neutral b?)) or low (he will try to stomp you) but if you can get his jumps out using dair or something else, his up b is not very good.

12/4/2024		999	Fleet	L	OXX	987	Na Wtf	1002	Zetterburn	Julesvale	1	Hyperborean Harbor	-1	Godai Delta	-2	TIL zetter has a di mixup on throw where he gets an up smash if i di in on down throw (if im expecting f throw kill throw). Using nair and bair were really effective for stopping his recovery, maybe I should also try fair since it has a bigger hitbox. Should parry more.			More ISF Nair	
12/4/2024		987	Fleet	W	OO-	997	Sir Cire	935	Loxodont	Julesvale	1	Tempest Peak	2			Lox is slow, we just gotta play it slow and punish his mistakes. I don't like tempest peak. Slow falling fair to get a grab aftgerwards seems like a good plan			More ISF Nair	
12/4/2024		997	Fleet	L	XOX	988	Headcoald	1066	Clairen	Aetherean Forest	-1	Julesvale	2	Rock Wall	-2	Two unfortunate SDs game 1. Getting a lot of mileage off of parries. Got camped like crazy on rock wall. I think I need to ban rock wall against clairen. I need to play more patiently when I'm being camped. More parries. The clairens love to do down air on shield			More ISF Nair

12/4/2024		969	Fleet	W	OO-	977	emb1234	858	Orcane	Godai Delta	2	Godai Delta	1			Watch out for stray fsmashes, they stay trying to go for these. Parrying the water will be good.

12/4/2024		977	Fleet	L	XX-	966	LawyerDog	998	Fleet	Godai Delta	-1	Julesvale	-1			I got outplayed here. His neutral was better and punish was better. He really destroyed me with the fair nair edgeguard, and I need to practice this			More ISF Nair	
12/4/2024		966	Fleet	W	XOO	979	Femcel Gooner	991	Loxodont	Aetherean Forest	-1	Godai Delta	1	Hodojo	1	Need to not try to get too much mileage with descending dairs after juggle, since it is easy to counterplay and punish. Gotta respect his punish way more and di out ,  especially at high percent. Use float to pressure platform from the side rather than from beneath, because they can shield drop and punish. This guy was really good about using the platforms to avoid me, I need to become more comfortable on platforms.			More ISF Nair	
12/4/2024		979	Fleet	W	OO-	993	Mephiles	1041	Forsburn	Julesvale	2	Fire Capital	3			Not sure why this guy SD'd 3 times on purpose game 2. Grabbing ledge seems to be a really good option against forsburn since his recovery is a teleport with some lag afterwards.				
12/4/2024		993	Fleet	L	XX-	980	Red the Demon Fox	938	Zetterburn	Godai Delta	-2	Julesvale	-1			This guy is super fast and I need to focus on my punishes. He is running in circles around me on the platforms. ISF nair is a good grb follo up. This one played too fast for me, very defensively. I need to slow myself down better instead of running into stupid stuff.

12/4/2024		969	Fleet	L	XX-	958	rat girl	1001	Loxodont	Godai Delta	-1	Julesvale	-1			I had game 2 in the bag but I got edgehogged at 10% when he was at 100+ on last stock because I went too aggressive offstage. Unfortunate. Game 2 went way better than game 1 with trying to slow down neutral and focus on punish.				
12/4/2024		958	Fleet	L	XX-	945	Captain Caine	926	Forsburn	Godai Delta	-1	Aetherean Forest	-1			I did not win game 1 because I was focusing on doing more ISF nair, BUT I did a ton of them and it worked really well. Feel good about it. Gotta figure out where to work it in now. Same with game 2.

12/4/2024		944	Fleet	W	OXO	956	Darwin Watterson	950	Clairen	Aetherean Forest	1	Godai Delta	-1	Julesvale	1	Parrying after an opponent whiffs an attack is good because they will often attack again. Especially clairen after cross up on shield. I got a lot of mileage off of parrying clairens thing. Want to get better at edgeguards.				
12/4/2024		956	Fleet	L	XX-	943	Richard and Blaziken	908	Ranno	Julesvale	-1	Godai Delta	-1			This guy is using his double jump every single time to come  down on me, I wish I had better anti air options. Next game I will try to dashback and then punish with ISF nair. Campy play really is my bane.				
12/4/2024		943	Fleet	L	XX-	932	Ender	963	Clairen	Godai Delta	-1	Godai Delta	-1			Getting good mileage off of parries. Need to try to figure out better punishes from them, but that will come in timme.				
12/4/2024		932	Fleet	W	OXO	944	hex	943	Clairen	Julesvale	1	Hodojo	-1	Godai Delta	1	I got lucky and he essentially SD'd game 1 last stock. He is playing very patiently, but I am doing better with ISF nair punishes. Gotta keep working at those. Game 2 blew a 1 stock lead by playing impatient neutral fishing for the last kill. Need to be patient. Won the last game off of a parry. Nice job Sam.

I can;t let the tilt get the better of me

I am reacting with a nair which he is now shielding.  Gotta think more about parrying the down b spikes. Hodojo is not a good stage for fleet in this matchup. I approached too much.

Parries are my friend. Jump offtage immediately for edgeguards, or stay on stage to threaten. Don't wait then go, because my moves lose to firefox unless it's from the side. Hard matchup.

This guy is doing nothing but dash attacking which is a good burst movement option, and double jump dairing on me. I can't play aggressively at all because I am simply too slow. Clairen is too fast for me. When I am playing against someone too fast I need to not get flustered and throw out bad attacks.			Slow down neutral, ISF Nair, Parries

SD'd at the end of game 2 but i was also getting outplayed. When he runs backwards, I need to expect him to come right back in with an attack. Using fair on firefox is seeming better and better. Almost blew a really big lead game three last stock when he started platform camping me but we got there. ISF is so good wow wow wow wow			ISF nair

2/7/2025	2:45:24 PM	947	Fleet	W	OO-	958	Its_Just_Bob	933	Kragg	Godai Delta	1	Rock Wall	2			game 1 was last stock but i sealed it out. this matchup is so hard because i need to respect kragg like crazy, and edgeguarding is close to nonexistent. i got this though. game 2 i destroyed him. just gotta play smart.
